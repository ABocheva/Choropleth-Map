# Choropleth-Map
This is my solution to freecodecamp data visualisation project four- Visualise data with Choropleth Map. 
I was following their user stories, which you can find here: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map
This course introduces how to use D3 library and how to transfer and use data using AJAX technologies with a freecodecamp API.
